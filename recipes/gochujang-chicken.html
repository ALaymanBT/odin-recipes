        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Juicy, tender chicken bites in sweet, spicy, savoury gochujang sauce. What's not to like? This Korean-inspired spicy gochujang stir-fried chicken is easy, only requires few ingredients to make, and tastes amazing! And some word of advice, it's extra yummy and so so satisfying to eat with a bowl of warm, freshly cooked, steamy white rice. An easy favourite!</p>
